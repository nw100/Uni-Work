I've now marked the hailstone assignment & here's the feedback.

The marking process went like this :

Panos went through the assignments flagging any particular
difficulties or issues. I then marked everyone's assignment
giving a `rough' grade.

I then compared work with the same grade, making sure it was in
fact of a similar standard and re-ranked them.

General Comments :

Despite my lectures, lots of people were still making basic
mistakes, such as functions being too long, code not being
self-documenting, using global variables and magic numbers
appearing. I'm trying to get you to write code that looks a
little like mine!

Common Errors:
Magic number 50000
Overwhelming documentation
Lack of documentation…
Calloc - malloc without free()
Calloc - malloc without success checking
Main function is not divided in small tasks
Variables are declared inside the body function, not at the beginning.
Not using gcc -pedantic -Wall -std=c99
Not capitalizing #defines
Submitting an file named Hail, hailstones, assignment1
The main function was not returning int value.
Function that was supposed to return a value to main was not used properly by main.
Repetitive code.
Inconsistent identation.


Two submissions have been referred to our plagiarism panel.


Specific Comments :
Candidate Number : 64476
Unit : M1211

Comments (if any) : Documentation was exhausting. The main function is responsible for everything which is something to avoid.

Rough mark before ranking = 55%

Final Mark, after ranking = 61%
