Pasta with fried Pancetta and a Tomato and Basil Sauce

Cooking really doesn't get any easier than this, and you'll end up with a super tasty meal in under 10 mintes - even quicker if you don't include
the time the kettle takes to boil!

		Serves: 1
		Time taken: 4 minutes (max: as long as the pasta takes)
		Cost estimate: £1.50
				
				Ingredients:
					125g Fresh Pasta (I went for Fusilli)
					50g Pancetta cubes
					2-3tbsp Tomato and Basil Sauce (shop bought pre-made sauce)
					
				Remember to check out how long some of the ingredients take to cook. The pasta will normally take the longest (mine was 4 minutes), and the sauce the shortest.
							
					1. First, boil the kettle! Whilst you're waiting for it to boil, weigh out your pasta into a saucepan, 
					and put a glug of olive oil into a frying pan.
					
					2. As the kettle reaches the boil, turn the heat on for your frying pan - medium-hot. When the kettle boils, 
					pour it over your pasta and turn on the hob.
					
					3. My pasta only took 4 minutes, so I waited a minute before I added the pancetta to the pan - if your pasta
					takes longer, then you should wait until there's only 3 minutes left before you add the pancetta.
					
					4. Stir the pancetta and pasta every so often. When you reach your last minute of cooking, add the sauce to the frying pan.
					
					5. When the pasta is ready, drain it and add it to the pan with the pancetta/sauce. Give it a good stir!
					
					6. Serve!
