This project was split into two parts, client side and server side. 

The client side required us to create our own website, with a theme of our choice. Mine was a food blog type website, focussing
on restaurants, reviews, recipes and so on (although, like many taking the module, our websites actually lacked any real content).
We were to write XHTML5, CCS3 and use open source software to create images (specifically inkscape and gimp) to get a grip with
painting and drawing software. I also added in a lot of SVG (hand-written as opposed to creating images in inkscape). 

The second part of the project was to fill in the server side part of our website. We used Apache Derby for our database, Tomcat for 
the server bit, and used Javascript and any additional JS libraries we wanted.
